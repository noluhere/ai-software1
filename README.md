Introduction
This project is a simple rule-based chatbot designed to provide basic investment advice on selected cryptocurrencies. 
The chatbot uses predefined rules based on factors such as price trend, energy efficiency, project viability, market capitalization, and volatility to generate advice.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate a basic implementation of a rule-based system for providing recommendations based on structured data. 
It serves as a foundational example for building more complex advisory systems.
